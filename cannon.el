;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Simulate Dmenu application launcher program
;; to dynamic/interactive launch applications/commands
;; regarding $PATH environment variable using Emacs vanilla builtin
;; facilities (minibuffer/completions).
;;
;; If you use =Exwm=, i.e, =Emacs= also as your =X Window Manager=
;; this package will be a good choice to launch =X11= applications,
;; like: =mpv=, =mupdf=, lxrandr, etc, empowering even more the
;; user experience.
;;
;; In more details, a simple lightweight application launcher that
;; has no outside dependencies (we rely on the =completing-read=
;; built-in =C= function), but if you use some narrowing/selecting
;; framework, like - =helm=, =ivy=, etc - it's easy to use =cannon= as
;; a source for candidates, just call/invoke the function
;; =cannon-get-cmd-candidates= at some point inside you =Elisp=
;; interface code to get the executable candidates.
;;
;; The name is a joke about launching =Chrome= web browser inside
;; =Emacs/Exwm=, a heavily metal ball which causes nightmares.
;;
;; PS: Works pretty well with Icomplete! (rules)!
